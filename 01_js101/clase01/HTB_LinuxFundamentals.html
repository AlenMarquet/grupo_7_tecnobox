<!-- Firewall Setup -->
<!-- Iptables : The main components of iptables are: -->
<!-- Tables : Tables are used to organize and categorize firewall rules.
Chains : Chains are used to group a set of firewall rules applied to a specific type of network traffic.
Rules : Rules define the criteria for filtering network traffic and the actions to take for packets that match the criteria.
Matches : Matches are used to match specific criteria for filtering network traffic, such as source or destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and more.
Targets : Targets specify the action for packets that match a specific rule. For example, targets can be used to accept, drop, or reject packets or modify the packets in another way. -->

<!-- Tables -->
<!-- Table Name	/ Description / Built-in Chains
filter / Used to filter network traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. / INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD
nat / Used to modify the source or destination IP addresses of network packets. / PREROUTING, POSTROUTING
mangle / Used to modify the header fields of network packets. / PREROUTING, OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD, POSTROUTING -->
<!-- In addition to the built-in tables, iptables provides a fourth table called the raw table, which is used to configure special packet processing options. The raw table contains two built-in chains: PREROUTING and OUTPUT. -->

<!-- Chains -->
<!-- Built-in chains / User-defined chains -->
<!-- Examples of built in chains: Filter -->
<!-- INPUT / OUTPUT / FORWARD -->

<!-- Rules and Targets : rules are used to define the criteria for filtering network traffic and the actions to take for packets that match the criteria. Rules are added to chains using the -A option followed by the chain name -->
<!-- Target Name / Description
ACCEPT / Allows the packet to pass through the firewall and continue to its destination
DROP / Drops the packet, effectively blocking it from passing through the firewall
REJECT / Drops the packet and sends an error message back to the source address, notifying them that the packet was blocked
LOG / Logs the packet information to the system log
SNAT / Modifies the source IP address of the packet, typically used for Network Address Translation (NAT) to translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses
DNAT / Modifies the destination IP address of the packet, typically used for NAT to forward traffic from one IP address to another
MASQUERADE / Similar to SNAT but used when the source IP address is not fixed, such as in a dynamic IP address scenario
REDIRECT / Redirects packets to another port or IP address
MARK / Adds or modifies the Netfilter mark value of the packet, which can be used for advanced routing or other purposes-->
<!-- Example: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

<!-- Matches : used to specify the criteria that determine whether a firewall rule should be applied to a particular packet or connection-->
<!-- Match Name / Description
-p or --protocol / Specifies the protocol to match (e.g. tcp, udp, icmp)
--dport / Specifies the destination port to match
--sport / Specifies the source port to match
-s or --source / Specifies the source IP address to match
-d or --destination / Specifies the destination IP address to match
-m state / Matches the state of a connection (e.g. NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED)
-m multiport / Matches multiple ports or port ranges
-m tcp / Matches TCP packets and includes additional TCP-specific options
-m udp / Matches UDP packets and includes additional UDP-specific options
-m string / Matches packets that contain a specific string
-m limit / Matches packets at a specified rate limit
-m conntrack / Matches packets based on their connection tracking information
-m mark / Matches packets based on their Netfilter mark value
-m mac / Matches packets based on their MAC address
-m iprange / Matches packets based on a range of IP addresses -->
<!-- Example: -->
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
<!-- This example rule matches incoming TCP traffic (-p tcp) on port 80 (--dport 80) and jumps to the accept target (-j ACCEPT) if the match is successful. -->


<!-- System Logs : There are several different types of system logs on Linux, including:-->
<!-- Kernel Logs / System Logs / Authentication Logs / Application Logs / Security Logs -->

<!-- System logs : These logs contain information about system-level events, such as service starts and stops, login attempts, and system reboots. They are stored in the /var/log/syslog file -->

<!-- Authentication logs : These logs contain information about user authentication attempts, including successful and failed attempts. They are stored in the /var/log/auth.log file. -->

<!-- Application logs : These logs contain information about the activities of specific applications running on the system. They are often stored in their own files, such as /var/log/apache2/error.log for the Apache web server or /var/log/mysql/error.log for the MySQL database server. -->
<!-- On Linux systems, most common services have default locations for access logs: -->
<!-- Apache / Access logs are stored in the /var/log/apache2/access.log file (or similar, depending on the distribution).
Nginx / Access logs are stored in the /var/log/nginx/access.log file (or similar).
OpenSSH / Access logs are stored in the /var/log/auth.log file on Ubuntu and in /var/log/secure on CentOS/RHEL.
MySQL / Access logs are stored in the /var/log/mysql/mysql.log file.
PostgreSQL / Access logs are stored in the /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-version-main.log file.
Systemd / Access logs are stored in the /var/log/journal/ directory. -->

<!-- Security logs : These security logs and their events are often recorded in a variety of log files, depending on the specific security application or tool in use. For example, the Fail2ban application records failed login attempts in the /var/log/fail2ban.log file, while the UFW firewall records activity in the /var/log/ufw.log file.-->
