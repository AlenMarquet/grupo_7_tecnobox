<!-- Code Obfuscation -->
<!-- Obfuscation is a technique used to make a script more difficult to read by humans -->
<!--  but allows it to function the same from a technical point of view, though performance may be slower. -->
<!-- This is usually achieved automatically by using an obfuscation tool, which takes code as an input,
     and attempts to re-write the code in a way that is much more difficult to read,
      depending on its design. -->

<!-- Minifying JavaScript code -->
<!-- Code minification means having the entire code in a single (often very long) line -->
<!-- Usually, minified JavaScript code is saved with the extension .min.js. -->

<!-- Packing JavaScript code -->
<!-- First, we will try BeautifyTools to obfuscate our code: -->
Code: javascript
eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[c]=k[c]||c}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('5.4(\'3 2 1 0\');',6,6,'Module|Deobfuscation|JavaScript|HTB|log|console'.split('|'),0,{}))
<!-- A packer obfuscation tool usually attempts to convert all words and symbols of the code 
    into a list or a dictionary and then refer to them using the (p,a,c,k,e,d) function to re-build 
    the original code during execution.  -->


<!-- Advanced Obfuscation -->
<!-- Obfuscator -->
<!-- visit https://obfuscator.io. -->
<!-- Before we click obfuscate, we will change String Array Encoding to Base64 -->
<!-- Now, we can paste our code and click obfuscate: -->
<!--  Try playing with the obfuscation settings in https://obfuscator.io to generate even 
    more obfuscated code, and then try rerunning it in https://jsconsole.com to verify it still 
    performs its original function. -->

<!-- More Obfuscation -->
<!-- We can try obfuscating code using the same tool in JSF -->
<!-- There are many other JavaScript obfuscators, like JJ Encode or AA Encode -->


<!-- Deobfuscation -->
<!-- Beautify -->
<!-- We see that the current code we have is all written in a single line -->
<!-- This is known as Minified JavaScript code. In order to properly format the code, 
    we need to Beautify our code.  -->
<!-- The most basic method for doing so is through our Browser Dev Tools. -->
<!--  if we were using Firefox, we can open the browser debugger with [ CTRL+SHIFT+Z ] -->
<!-- then click on our script secret.js -->
<!-- This will show the script in its original formatting, but we can click on the '{ }' button 
    at the bottom, which will Pretty Print the script into its proper JavaScript formatting: -->
<!-- Furthermore, we can utilize many online tools or code editor plugins, like Prettier or Beautifier
     Let us copy the secret.js script: -->
Code: javascript
eval(function (p, a, c, k, e, d) { e = function (c) { return c.toString(36) }; if (!''.replace(/^/, String)) { while (c--) { d[c.toString(a)] = k[c] || c.toString(a) } k = [function (e) { return d[e] }]; e = function () { return '\\w+' }; c = 1 }; while (c--) { if (k[c]) { p = p.replace(new RegExp('\\b' + e(c) + '\\b', 'g'), k[c]) } } return p }('g 4(){0 5="6{7!}";0 1=8 a();0 2="/9.c";1.d("e",2,f);1.b(3)}', 17, 17, 'var|xhr|url|null|generateSerial|flag|HTB|flag|new|serial|XMLHttpRequest|send|php|open|POST|true|function'.split('|'), 0, {}))
<!-- We can see that both websites do a good job in formatting the code: -->
<!-- However, the code is still not very easy to read. -->
<!-- This is because the code we are dealing with was not only minified but obfuscated as well.  -->
<!-- So, simply formatting or beautifying the code will not be enough. For that, 
    we will require tools to deobfuscate the code. -->

<!-- Deobfuscate -->
<!-- We can find many good online tools to deobfuscate JavaScript code and turn it into 
    something we can understand.  -->
<!-- One good tool is JSNice.  -->
<!-- Let's try copying our above-obfuscated code and run it in JSNice by clicking 
    the Nicify JavaScript button. -->
<!-- Tip: We should click on the options button next to the "Nicify JavaScript" button, 
    and de-select "Infer types" to reduce cluttering the code with comments. -->
<!-- Tip: Ensure you do not leave any empty lines before the script, as it may affect the 
    deobfuscation process and give inaccurate results. -->
<!-- We can see that this tool does a much better job in deobfuscating the JavaScript code 
    and gave us an output we can understand: -->
Code: javascript
'use strict';
function generateSerial() {
  ...SNIP...
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest;
  var url = "/serial.php";
  xhr.open("POST", url, true);
  xhr.send(null);
};
<!-- As previously mentioned, the above-used method of obfuscation is packing. 
    Another way of unpacking such code is to find the return value at the end and use console.log 
    to print it instead of executing it. -->

<!-- Reverse Engineering -->
<!-- once the code becomes more obfuscated and encoded, it would become much more difficult 
    for automated tools to clean it up. -->
<!--  This is especially true if the code was obfuscated using a custom obfuscation tool. -->
<!-- We would need to manually reverse engineer the code to understand how it was obfuscated and 
    its functionality for such cases. -->
<!-- If you are interested in knowing more about advanced JavaScript Deobfuscation and 
    Reverse Engineering, you can check out the Secure Coding 101 module, 
    which should thoroughly cover this topic. -->


<!-- Code Analysis -->
<!-- Now that we have deobfuscated the code, we can start going through it: -->
Code: javascript
'use strict';
function generateSerial() {
  ...SNIP...
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest;
  var url = "/serial.php";
  xhr.open("POST", url, true);
  xhr.send(null);
};
<!-- We see that the secret.js file contains only one function, generateSerial. -->

<!-- HTTP Requests -->
<!-- Let us look at each line of the generateSerial function. -->
<!-- Code Variables -->
<!-- The function starts by defining a variable xhr, which creates an object of XMLHttpRequest. -->
<!--  As we may not know exactly what XMLHttpRequest does in JavaScript, 
    let us Google XMLHttpRequest to see what it is used for. -->
<!-- After we read about it, we see that it is a JavaScript function that handles web requests. -->
<!-- The second variable defined is the URL variable, which contains a URL to /serial.php, 
    which should be on the same domain, as no domain was specified. -->

<!-- Code Functions -->
<!-- Next, we see that xhr.open is used with "POST" and URL -->
<!-- We can Google this function once again, and we see that it opens the HTTP request defined 
    'GET or POST' to the URL, and then the next line xhr.send would send the request. -->
<!-- So, all generateSerial is doing is simply sending a POST request to /serial.php, 
    without including any POST data or retrieving anything in return. -->
<!-- The developers may have implemented this function whenever they need to generate a serial, 
    like when clicking on a certain Generate Serial button, for example -->
<!-- However, since we did not see any similar HTML elements that generate serials, 
    the developers must not have used this function yet and kept it for future use. -->
<!-- With the use of code deobfuscation and code analysis, we were able to uncover this function. 
    We can now attempt to replicate its functionality to see if it is handled on the server-side 
    when sending a POST request. If the function is enabled and handled on the server-side, 
    we may uncover an unreleased functionality, which usually tends to have bugs and vulnerabilities 
    within them. -->


<!-- HTTP Requests -->
<!-- In the previous section, we found out that the secret.js main function is sending an empty POST 
    request to /serial.php. In this section, we will attempt to do the same using cURL to send a POST
     request to /serial.php. -->

<!-- cURL -->

/* POST Request */
/* To send a POST request, we should add the -X POST flag to our command,

/* However, POST request usually contains POST data. To send data, we can use the "-d "param1=sample"" 
flag and include our data for each parameter, as follows: */

/* This is another important aspect of obfuscation that we referred to in More Obfuscation in 
the Advanced Obfuscation section */
/* Many techniques can further obfuscate the code and make it less readable by humans and less 
detectable by systems. For that reason, you will very often find obfuscated code containing encoded 
text blocks that get decoded upon execution. We will cover 3 of the most commonly used text encoding 
methods: */
/* base64
   hex
   rot13 */

/* Base64 */
/* base64 encoding is usually used to reduce the use of special characters, as any characters encoded 
in base64 would be represented in alpha-numeric characters, in addition to + and / only. 
Regardless of the input, even if it is in binary format, the resulting base64 encoded string would 
only use them. */

/* Spotting Base64 */
/* base64 encoded strings are easily spotted since they only contain alpha-numeric characters. 
However, the most distinctive feature of base64 is its padding using = characters. 
The length of base64 encoded strings has to be in a multiple of 4. If the resulting output is only 3 
characters long, for example, an extra = is added as padding, and so on. */

/* Base64 Encode */
/* To encode any text into base64 in Linux, we can echo it and pipe it with '|' to base64: */
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | base64

aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGFja3RoZWJveC5ldS8K

/* Base64 Decode */
/* If we want to decode any base64 encoded string, we can use base64 -d, as follows: */
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ echo aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGFja3RoZWJveC5ldS8K | base64 -d

https://www.hackthebox.eu/

/* Hex */
/* Another common encoding method is hex encoding, which encodes each character into its hex order in
 the ASCII table. For example, a is 61 in hex, b is 62, c is 63, and so on. You can find the full 
 ASCII table in Linux using the man ascii command. */

/* Spotting Hex */
/* Any string encoded in hex would be comprised of hex characters only, which are 16 characters only:
 0-9 and a-f. That makes spotting hex encoded strings just as easy as spotting base64 encoded strings. */

/* Hex Encode */
/* To encode any string into hex in Linux, we can use the xxd -p command: */
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | xxd -p

68747470733a2f2f7777772e6861636b746865626f782e65752f0a

/* Hex Decode */
/* To decode a hex encoded string, we can use the xxd -p -r command: */
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ echo 68747470733a2f2f7777772e6861636b746865626f782e65752f0a | xxd -p -r

https://www.hackthebox.eu/

/* Caesar/Rot13 */
/* Another common -and very old- encoding technique is a Caesar cipher, which shifts each letter by a
 fixed number. For example, shifting by 1 character makes a become b, and b becomes c, and so on. 
 Many variations of the Caesar cipher use a different number of shifts, the most common of which is 
 rot13, which shifts each character 13 times forward. */

/* Spotting Caesar/Rot13 */
/* Even though this encoding method makes any text looks random, it is still possible to spot it 
because each character is mapped to a specific character. For example, in rot13, http://www becomes
 uggc://jjj, which still holds some resemblances and may be recognized as such. */

/* Rot13 Encode */
/* There isn't a specific command in Linux to do rot13 encoding. However, it is fairly easy to create
 our own command to do the character shifting: */
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

uggcf://jjj.unpxgurobk.rh/

/* Rot13 Decode */
/* We can use the same previous command to decode rot13 as well: */
Warstone@htb[/htb]$ echo uggcf://jjj.unpxgurobk.rh/ | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

https://www.hackthebox.eu/
/* Another option to encode/decode rot13 would be using an online tool, like rot13. */
